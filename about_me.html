                    <p>Throughout my life, my goal has been to use engineering and technology to improve lives everyday and take steps towards tackling climate change. In order to achieve this, I've been involved with running and participating in a variety of community, city-wide, and school events. As a result, I've been able to continuously build strong leadership, responsibility, organizing, communication, and teamwork skills that will ultimately help me achieve my lifelong goal. This has also resulted in me winning many awards that I am grateful for. Below are some skills I gained, places where I was involved, and awards that I have won.</p>
